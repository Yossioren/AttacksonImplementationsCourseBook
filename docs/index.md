Basic reading is Chapters 7 and 8 of the Coursebook; Whereas chapter 5 mainly focused on low data complexity attacks (with few traces), chapter 7 focuses on high data complexity attacks, aka DPA and CPA (many, many traces). It revisits the Vaizata method and how it can be used for high data complexity attacks, similarly to timing attacks (this time the assumption is that the power consumption is depended on the key). At 7.2 we demonstrate an attack on AES using example data from the [Power Analysis Attacks book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-38162-6) and visualize the process.

## How To Compile The Handbook
### Windows
#### Toolchain Installation
1. Install MikTex from: https://miktex.org/download (with default settings). NOTE that although Tex Live is supposedly a decent alternative to MikTex on windows - attempts to use it for compiling the book failed miserably.
2. Install Perl from: http://strawberryperl.com/
3. [Optional but Recommended] Install VSCode and the **LaTeX Workshop** extension to be able to compile from VSCode.
4. [Optional but Recommended] Install the **LaTex language support** VSCode extension to ease editing in VSCode.
#### Full book Compilation
- From VSCode: open UniversityCourseBookAOI.tex, click on the "TEX" icon in the left sidebar, run the "Build LaTeX project" command.
- Without VSCode: run `latexmk` from the root directory of the book repository

Other operating systems: just run `latexmk`
